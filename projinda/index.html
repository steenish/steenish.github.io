        <p>The first week deadline was not really met, but at least we have a "game" that can be played now. Controls are W, A, S and D (alt. arrow keys). Left and right controls the rudder, up and down controls the sail. The goal is to sail your boat (yellow dot on the minimap) to the goal (red dot on the minimap).</p>
