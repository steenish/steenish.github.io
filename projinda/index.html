      <h3>Week 1</h3>
      <p class="date">2018-05-02</p>
      <p>The first week deadline was not really met, but at least we have a "game" that can be played now. Controls are W, A, S and D (alt. arrow keys). Left and right controls the rudder, up and down controls the sail. The goal is to sail your boat (yellow dot on the minimap) to the goal (red dot on the minimap).</p>

      <h3>Week 2</h3>
      <p class="date">2018-05-08</p>
      <p>The second week deadline was not met either. However, significant progress has been made in making the "game" into a game, with a goal, gameplay, challenges and actions.</p>
      <p>New things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Game world</li>
        <li>Cities</li>
        <li>Updated minimap</li>
        <li>Missions and score</li>
        <li>Player death</li>
        <li>Background music</li>

      <h3>Week 3</h3>
      <p class="date">2018-05-17</p>
      <p>The third week deadline was not met. This week mainly consisted of implementing enemies, health, damage and weapons. Also, the UI was improved and sound effects and a water sprite were added. Controls for hoisting and lowering the sail was added (press Q). The weapons are controlled by left alt and left control. Left alt does not work well in a browser, so the left and right mouse buttons can also be used for shooting.</p>
      <p>New things:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Primitive enemies</li>
        <li>Player health</li>
        <li>Weapons</li>
        <li>Water sprite</li>
        <li>Improved UI</li>
        <li>Sound effects</li>
