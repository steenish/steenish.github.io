        <h3>There and Back Again: a LotR visualization</h3>
        <h4 class="date">2021-03-19</h4>
        <p>As part of the course DH2321 Information Visualization at KTH, I was part of a team with four other people,
          and we created <a href="https://lotr-project.vercel.app/demo">this visualization</a>. It shows the paths that
          the major characters of the Lord of the Rings trilogy take through the story, on a large interactive map.</p>
        <p>My responsibility were prototyping in D3, creating the paths and creating promotional graphics.</p>

        <img src="img/breakr.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;">
        <p>I got tired of setting timers to know when to take breaks from work and study, so I solved the problem by
          creating the app called <a
            href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.geodropstudios.breakr">Breakr and released it on
            Google Play</a>. I learned Android Studio rudimentally, and coded in Kotlin for the first time, and I'm
          pretty happy with the resulting app!</p>

        <img src="img/yt_decliner.png" style="float: left; margin-right: 1em;">
        <p>I know that I and probably many others have problems with putting YouTube down and not click on the next
          recommended video endlessly. Therefore, I created the Chrome extension <a
            href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/youtube-recommendation-de/feoddkggeangnmgoomlcdldcffoidake">YouTube
            Recommendation Decliner</a> to automatically decline all recommended videos on YouTube. This is the first
          time I have dabbled in Chrome extensions, and it taught me a lot about how browsers work, and releasing on a
          new platform is always highly educational.</p>

        <h4 class="date">2020-08-06</h4>
        <p><a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/research/projects/" target="_blank">CorSA</a> is a research project that is
          funded by <a href="https://wasp-sweden.org/" target="_blank">Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software
            Program (WASP)</a>. I was hired as a research engineer to create a human-robot interaction simulation that
          is essentially a game of chicken between the human agent and a robot. I was also tasked with making the
          simulation accessible via Amazon Mechanical Turk, and for collecting the experiment data.</p>
        <p>A demo of the final version of the simulation (where no data is collected) is available <a

        <h3>River simulation using metaballs</h3>
        <h4 class="date">2020-05-23</h4>
        <p>A project I did on my own in Unity as part of the course DH2323 Computer Graphics and Interaction. The goal
          was to explore the possibility of using metaballs to create a river simulation. During the course of the
          project a <a href="https://metawater.blogspot.com/">project blog</a> was continually updated. The blog now
          contains the entire project progress history. The project's final result is available on the blog, and the
          final demo is also embedded below. The project report that was written after the implementation was complete
          is available <a href="grafint/ProjectReport.pdf">here</a>.</p>

        <h3>Faeria Eye Tracking Plugin</h3>
        <h4 class="date">2019-06-12</h4>
        <p>This project was made by a group of eight people including me in the course DD1393 Software Engineering in
          collaboration with a company called Tobii. The project was about developing a plugin for the virtual card game
          Faeria, which is developed using Unity, so that it could be played using your eyes when using one of Tobii's
          eye trackers. The project was nearly fully completed, but it was not possible to publish the plugin, despite
          the great majority of the project's goals being reached, and nearly all aspect of the game being playable
          using just your eyes. The main concepts of the plugin are shown in the video demo below, where everything that
          happens is controlled using an eye tracker.</p>

        <h4 class="date">2021-06-13</h4>
        <p>This game was made by me and my brother using Unity, as part of the GMTK 2021 game jam. It ended up in 56th
          place out of 5766 entries, meaning the top one percent! All the top 100 games of the jam are considered
          "winners", so I'm very excited about having created this game.</p>
        <p>I did all the coding and some of the sound design, while my brother designed and created the art. We

        <h3>Bachelor's thesis: Evaluating the utility of a contract compositionality proof framework</h3>
        <h4 class="date">2020-09-08</h4>
        <p>My thesis partner was Anton Lövström and our supervisor was Dilian Gurov.</p>
        <p>The thesis was written with KTH and published on KTH's publication database DiVA. <a
            href="http://urn.kb.se/resolve?urn=urn:nbn:se:kth:diva-280343" target="_blank">This link</a> leads to the
          publication website.</p>
        <p>The subject of the thesis is the evaluation of a framework for proving the correctness of compositions in
          system-level contracts. The framework was developed earlier by Mattias Nyberg, Jonas Westman and Dilian Gurov.
